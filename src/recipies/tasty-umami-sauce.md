# A tasty sauce used for flavoring

Use this sauce on sautés or stir-fires to boost flavor without adding all the sodium of soy sauce. Umami is one of the five basic tastes, event though many people are only learning about it now. This word was created by a Japanese chemist named Kikunae Ikeda from umai, which means 'delicious', and mi which means 'taste. The perfect name, as it is a delicous taste.

Heat the broth in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger and simmer for 3 minutes. Stir in the molasses, Date Syrup, tomato purèe and black pepper and bring just to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 minute. Remove from the heat, and then stir in the miso mixture, blended lemon and rice vnegar. Taste and ajust the seasonings, if needed. Allow the sauce to cool before transferring to a jar or bottle with a tight-fitting lid or pouring the sauce into individual portions.
